Title: Review of ReaderWrangler.com

You are an avid reader of books using Amazon Kinde reader. Your problem is that your eyes are bigger than your stomach and you constantly buy books faster than you can read them. So because they are bargain books that might be good. Some are collections like the entire works of Robert E Howard. Some because they are the latest from a favorite author and favorite series. These are usually read immediately but due to purchases from the other classes, they can get pushed down in the view on amazon.com/yourbooks and/or on the kindle device.

You heard there was a new webapp ReaderWrangler.com that would help with this. You want to go find out if it will help with your situation. You decide you will also write a critical review of the app covering everything from functionality to documentation and ease of use, etc.

Please take a look at this site. Since you are actually an AI and can't run a browser, you will just have to read the docs,  description and screen captures how it works in lieu of being able to use it. Then write up the review. See screen captures and embedded mp4sfor examples.  Include what is good, what needs work., what you'd like to see ....

In the MP4 I forgot to show double clicking on a book shows the description, reviews, etc. see attached image. I'll make another video to include that at some point;

ReaderWrangler Review: A Specialized Solution for Kindle Library Chaos
The Problem It Solves
As an avid Kindle reader with over 2,300 books (and counting), I face exactly the problem ReaderWrangler aims to solve. Amazon's "Your Books" interface is beautiful but fundamentally limited—you can't organize, prioritize, or meaningfully group your collection. Great books get buried under bargain purchases, series get scattered, and that collection of Robert E. Howard you bought three years ago? Lost in the digital ether.

What ReaderWrangler Does Well
1. Clever Technical Approach
ReaderWrangler's bookmarklet-based extraction is genuinely innovative. Rather than requiring you to download local files, manage DRM, or navigate complex export processes, it scrapes your online Amazon library directly. This is a significantly simpler approach than competitors like Calibre or Kindlian that require local file management.

2. Privacy-First Design
Everything runs in your browser. Your library data never touches a server—it stays on your machine. For users concerned about data privacy (particularly their reading habits), this is a major selling point.

3. Visual Organization
The drag-and-drop column system is intuitive and powerful. Creating custom categories like "Next to Read," "Time Travel Books," or "Beach Reads" addresses the core organizational problem. The screenshot shows this working well with a clean, modern interface.

4. Rich Metadata Display
The detail view (shown in your screenshot) is comprehensive—cover art, ratings, reviews, descriptions, ASIN, acquisition date, and even a "Collect Series Books" button. This is more than just organization; it's rediscovery.

5. Incremental Updates
The ability to update only new additions without re-scraping your entire 2,000+ book library is crucial. This shows thoughtful design for long-term usability.

6. No Installation Required
As a web app with a bookmarklet, there's no software to install, no updates to manage, and no compatibility issues. It works on any modern browser.

What Needs Work
1. Documentation Gaps
While the website explains the concept well, practical documentation is thin:

No troubleshooting guide: What happens if the scrape fails partway through 2,000 books?
No FAQ: Common questions like "Can I use this with multiple Amazon accounts?" or "Does this work with Kindle Unlimited books?" are unanswered
Limited technical details: How does the bookmarklet handle Amazon's anti-scraping measures? What if Amazon changes their interface?
No data format documentation: What's in the JSON file? Can power users manipulate it directly?
2. The MP4 You Mentioned
You noted forgetting to show the double-click detail view in your video. This highlights a broader issue—relying on a single walkthrough video as primary documentation is risky. If users miss one feature, they may never discover it. A written feature guide with screenshots would complement the video nicely.

3. Bookmarklet UX Friction
The multi-step process (drag bookmarklet → navigate → fetch library → navigate again → fetch collections → launch app) is necessary but cumbersome. First-time users might get confused or impatient during a lengthy initial extraction. The site needs:

Progress indicators: "Extracting book 847 of 2,322..."
Error recovery: "Extraction interrupted. Click to resume from book 847."
Time estimates: "This will take approximately 15 minutes for your library size."
4. Amazon Collections Integration
The site mentions fetching collections data, but the screenshot shows everything in "Unorganized." It's unclear:

Do Amazon collections import automatically?
Can you export your ReaderWrangler organization back to Amazon?
Is there two-way sync, or is this one-directional?
5. Limited Filtering/Search Evidence
While the site mentions search by author/title, I don't see advanced filtering options in the screenshot. For a library of 2,322 books, users would benefit from:

Filter by genre/category
Filter by rating
Filter by acquisition date range
Filter by read/unread status (if Amazon provides this data)
Filter by series
6. No Mobile Support Clarity
The site doesn't address whether this works on mobile devices. Given that many people browse their libraries on phones/tablets, this is a significant omission.

7. Version Display Without Context
The screenshot shows "v3.5.3 • Fresh (31m ago)" but there's no changelog or update history. What changed in 3.5.3? What can users expect in future versions?

What I'd Like to See
Immediate Priorities
Comprehensive Documentation Hub
Detailed installation guide with screenshots for each step
Troubleshooting section with common issues
FAQ covering edge cases
Keyboard shortcuts reference
Data management (backup, export, import)
Enhanced Progress Feedback
Real-time progress bars during extraction
Estimated time remaining
Ability to pause/resume long extractions
Clear error messages with recovery options
Advanced Organization Features
Nested groups (e.g., "Science Fiction" → "Space Opera" → "Culture Series")
Color-coding or tagging system
Smart collections based on rules (e.g., "All unread books rated 4.5+")
Ability to mark books as read/unread if Amazon doesn't provide this
Better Series Management
The "Collect Series Books" button hints at this, but expand it
Automatic series detection
Series reading order visualization
Missing book detection ("You have books 1, 2, and 4 of this series")
Future Enhancements
Reading Stats Dashboard
Books acquired by month/year
Genre distribution pie chart
Average rating of your collection
"Time to read" estimates based on page counts
Export Options
Export organization to CSV/JSON for backup
Print-friendly reading list
Share reading lists with friends (privacy-respecting)
Integration Features
Goodreads sync (import ratings, mark as read)
StoryGraph integration
Export recommendations to Amazon wishlist
Smart Recommendations
"You own these similar books you haven't read yet"
"Others who loved [this book] also read [these books] from your library"
Highlight forgotten purchases based on high ratings
Multi-Device Sync (with opt-in)
Cloud storage option (self-hosted or encrypted)
Sync organization across devices while maintaining privacy
Bulk Operations
Multi-select with Shift/Ctrl clicks
Bulk move to collections
Bulk tagging
Bulk metadata editing
Special Considerations for Your Use Case
Given your specific situation:

Bargain book problem: ReaderWrangler helps by letting you create a "Bargain Bin" column where you can park speculative purchases, keeping your "Next to Read" queue focused on intentional choices
Large collections: The Robert E. Howard complete works could go in a "Collections" column with a note about which stories you've read
New releases from favorite authors: Create a "Priority Reading" column for these, so they don't get buried
Series management: The series detection feature (if it works well) could be transformative for keeping multi-book arcs organized
Competitive Position
ReaderWrangler occupies a unique niche. It's not trying to be Calibre (comprehensive ebook management with local files). It's specifically solving the "I have hundreds of Kindle books on Amazon and can't organize them" problem. For users who:

Primarily buy from Amazon
Don't want to manage local files
Value simplicity over advanced features
Care about privacy
...this is potentially the only tool that fits the need.

Final Verdict
What It Is: A clever, privacy-focused web tool that solves a specific problem Amazon refuses to address—meaningful organization of large Kindle libraries.

Strengths:

Innovative bookmarklet approach (8/10)
Privacy-first design (10/10)
Visual organization (9/10)
Zero installation friction (10/10)
Weaknesses:

Documentation (4/10)
User onboarding experience (5/10)
Advanced features (6/10)
Mobile support unclear (0/10 - not addressed)
Overall Rating: 7/10 - Highly functional for its niche, but needs polish

Recommendation: For Kindle users with 200+ books who are frustrated by Amazon's organization (or lack thereof), ReaderWrangler is absolutely worth trying. It's free, runs locally, and solves a real problem. However, expect some friction during initial setup, and don't expect hand-holding—you'll need to figure some things out through trial and error.

The developer is clearly responsive (regular updates, v3.5.3 shows active development) and has created something genuinely useful. With better documentation, more robust error handling, and the advanced features mentioned above, this could evolve from "useful niche tool" to "essential for any serious Kindle reader."

Bottom Line: It won't replace Calibre for power users managing local files, but for organizing your online Amazon library, nothing else comes close. Download your library data, give it 30 minutes to learn the interface, and you'll finally have control over your reading chaos.

P.S.: Given that you mentioned making another video to show the double-click detail view, I'd strongly encourage creating a "Quick Start" video (2-3 minutes) separate from the full walkthrough, and a written "First 5 Minutes" guide. Many users will bounce if they have to watch a 10-minute video before understanding the basics.
